## Stock Market App API

The REST api that supports a stock market web app [here](https://github.com/alextuck97/Stock-Market-Simulation-Frontend).

Routes implemented allow the user to
* Create an account
* Login/Logout and authenticate users with JSON Web Tokens
* Look at current market prices
* Favorite stocks they want to watch
* Remove stocks from their favorites list
* And more...

This project was built with Django, Django Rest Framework, and the yfinance Python module for scraping stock market data from Yahoo.
